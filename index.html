  <h2>About me</h2>
<p>I was born in Venezuela where I graduated as an electronic engineer, and shortly after I moved to Panama, where I started working as an assistant and slowly made my way up into construction and real estate.
While I worked as a Construction Project Manager for an island project I was also being involved with international real estate. Both these worlds, so close and so apart from each other, gave me the opportunity to gain experience and helped me truly understand all aspects of the business, from the construction side of it to the final sale of the product.
In 2014 I moved to the USA and got my real estate license in California where I became a realtor. I focus on residential real estate in the East Bay, both condos and single family homes. I pride myself in providing my clients with detailed information about the market, educating them through the process, and keeping an active line of communication open with them to ensure a smooth transaction while obtaining the best possible deal.
I am also an active member of the Bay Area community. I reside in North Oakland with my husband Frank and our rescue dogs, Amber & Ludo. If I am not working on something related to my career, I can easily be found training on my bike for the AIDS Lifecycle, hiking, painting, taking photographs, working out, helping the community, and working on home projects as well.
As a multicultural Real Estate Agent at Climb Real Estate, English-Spanish speaking, I provide my customers with a high quality of service and an agent who listens to their needs.</p>
