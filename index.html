  <h2>A journey into Web Development</h2>
  <p>I was born in Venezuela in 1982 and I was raised in Maracaibo City.<br>
    Maracaibo is a very hot city where temperatures range between 75ºF and 105ºF.<br>
    I studied in a technical highschool where I larned the bsics on electronics and<br>
    right after graduating from it, I decided to study Electrical Engineering, which <br>
    I did not finish because I decided to change into Electronic Engineering: Automation and Control Systems.<br>
    I graduated in December 2009 and shortly after I moved to Panama City, Panama.<br>
    During my time in Venezuela and right before college, I worked in different locations related to electronics and<br>
    computer repair. I also learned how to repair printers, scanners and many other electornic devices.<br>
    Once I started college, I worked as a sales man for car parts whole sales.<br>
    When I moved to Panama, I started working as a personal assistant and did not have the chance to<br>
    work as an engineer. Eventually this brought me into supervisin construction sites, then supervising personnel<br>
    that worked on the construction site and right after I became a project manager for an ISland Project.<br>
    After four and half years in Panama, I moved to the USA where I studied to be a Real Estate Agent in California<br>
    I did Real Estate for about a year and half but I was not fulfilled with the career so I decided to go back to techonology.<br>
    After talking to friends and researching about what is interesting outthere, I decided to learn some basics on<br>
    Web development and that is how I found out about General Assembly and decided to make the jump into this exciting career.
